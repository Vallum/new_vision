# New Vision Model
Hierarchical Machine Vision in complex modality

### Deep Learning
Everybody knows deep learning.

### So, what is deep learning?

Artificial Neural Networks
Convoultional Neural Networks

"Attention is All you need"

(BERT and GPT)

"Improving Language Understanding by GenerativePre-Training" GPT-1

GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT

Deep learning is 'interpreting' process of data.

### Visual Processing and Hierarchy in Science

Complicated and elaborate appratus, but Low level and Mid level

"We can replace much of them with CNN." They believe.

This is higher level vision with many modules.

Their functions are various, but anatomically they are homogeneous.

Nonetheless, there are entangled hierarchies.

But, do we understand higher level concepts by combining lower level concepts?

Classical vision learning seems to believe so.

### Visual Understanding in context

Do dogs differenciate a tiger and a stuffed animal?

![image](https://github.com/Vallum/new_vision/assets/30591790/55858ea9-afba-4978-8399-5b6772c112bd)

Do they even know about real tigers?

Do they really have the concept?

Apparently they have some fear about unknown monsters in their DNA and brain-wiring from the natural selection.

The bisons are indifferent about cars.

Do they know a car?

To understand this as a car.

![image](https://github.com/Vallum/new_vision/assets/30591790/14d5cf93-8084-46e4-8fa8-06b9e491decf)

To understand this as an airplane.

Do we just need many pictures?


### Vision in DL without descrptive interpretation

Without description, however there is always some context.

With class signature, a little bit of semiotics, but not with syntax or bag of words

Can we understand visual information only with visual information?

Never. We have already been dependent on semiotics

### Vision in DL with descrptive interpretation

With Language with bag of words and little syntax

![image](https://github.com/Vallum/new_vision/assets/30591790/04b5ec2b-3b14-4469-b94d-596c1bafb69d)

(Open AI, CLIP)

They are much better with abundent description.

### With Language with syntax

With Large Language models such as GPT-{3,4}, ChatGPT-{3,4}
